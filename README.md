## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM css principles

### What I learned
This challenge introduced me to a lot of new things!
Prior to this I had never used box-shadow. 

Also, in response to some helpful feedback by FEM user [MikDra1](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/MikDra1) I looked into the BEM naming conventions for css, which is what I used for this project.
